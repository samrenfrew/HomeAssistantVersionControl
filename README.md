# Home Assistant Version Control

**Automatic backup, history tracking, and instant restore for your Home Assistant configuration.**

Home Assistant Version Control provides complete version history for your setup. It automatically tracks every change to your YAML configuration files using a robust local Git backend. Browse your history, visualize diffs, and restore individual files or your entire configuration to any previous state with a single click.


##  What's New!

*   **Track Custom Paths:** Easily include folders like `/share` and `/media` in your version history. Perfect for tracking external configs (like Frigate) using Home Assistant mounts.
*   **More Than Just Lovelace:** Explicitly whitelist and version control specific files/patterns in the `.storage` directory (e.g., core.entity_registry).
*   **Keep Your Own Extensions:** Configure any file format to track and backup (.sh, .py, .json, etc.) directly in the config tab.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Securely connect to private repositories using persistent SSH keys and trusted CA certificates.
*   **Simple Remote Management:** Change your Git remote URL directly from the configuration tab without touching the command line.
*   **Polished Interface:** Enjoy resizable panels, subtle UI animations, and improved visibility for files tracked outside the main config folder.
*   **Confetti Mode:** Celebrate every successful restore with a realistic confetti burst (opt-in via settings).
*   **History Control:** New setting to choose exactly how many commits to keep in your history, helping manage storage on smaller devices.

## Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 1. **Existing Git Repos:** If you already have a `.git` folder in your `/config` directory, **back it up first**. The app will use your existing repository but may conflict with your workflow through auto-commits and automatic merging of old history. **For best results, delete the existing `.git` folder** and let the app create a fresh repository.
> 2. **Backup Strategy:** While this app provides excellent version control, **do not rely on it as your sole backup method**. Always maintain external backups (e.g., Google Drive, Samba) of your Home Assistant instance.

There are two ways to install Home Assistant Version Control: as a Home Assistant app or as a standalone Docker container.

### 1. Home Assistant App (Recommended for most users)

1.  **Add Repository:**
    Click the button below to add the repository to your Home Assistant instance:

    [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the app store](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https://github.com/saihgupr/ha-addons)

    **Or manually add it:**
    - Navigate to **Settings** → **Apps** → **App Store**
    - Click the three dots (⋮) in the top right corner and select **Repositories**
    - Add the repository URL:
      ```
      https://github.com/saihgupr/ha-addons
      ```
2.  **Install the App:**
    The "Home Assistant Version Control" app will now appear in the store. Click on it and then click "Install".

3.  **Start:** Start the app and click **"Open Web UI"** to access the interface.

4.  **Optional (External Access):** To access the UI externally at port `54001`, enable the port in the app's **Configuration** tab (disabled by default).

### 2. Standalone Docker Installation

<details>
<summary>Click to expand Docker deployment options</summary>

For Docker users who aren't using the Home Assistant app, you have three deployment options:

**Option A: Docker Compose (recommended):**

1. Download the compose.yaml file:
   ```bash
   curl -o compose.yaml https://github.com/saihgupr/HomeAssistantVersionControl/raw/develop/compose.yaml
   ```

2. Edit the file to set your paths and timezone:
   ```bash
   nano compose.yaml
   # Update the volume path: /path/to/your/ha/config
   # Update timezone: TZ environment variable (e.g., America/New_York)
   ```

3. Start the service:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

Access the interface at `http://localhost:54001`.

**Option B: Docker Run (pre-built image):**

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 54001:54001 \
  -v /path/to/your/config:/config \
  -e TZ=America/New_York \
  -e SUPERVISOR_TOKEN=your_long_lived_access_token_here \
  -e HA_URL=http://homeassistant.local:8123 \
  --name home-assistant-version-control \
  ghcr.io/saihgupr/home-assistant-version-control:latest
```

Replace `/path/to/your/config` with the actual path to your Home Assistant configuration directory.

**Option C: Build locally:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/saihgupr/HomeAssistantVersionControl.git
cd HomeAssistantVersionControl/homeassistant-version-control
docker build --build-arg BUILD_FROM=alpine:latest -t home-assistant-version-control .

docker run -d \
  -p 54001:54001 \
  -v /path/to/your/config:/config \
  -e TZ=America/New_York \
  -e SUPERVISOR_TOKEN=your_long_lived_access_token_here \
  -e HA_URL=http://homeassistant.local:8123 \
  --name home-assistant-version-control \
  home-assistant-version-control
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `SUPERVISOR_TOKEN` and `HA_URL` are optional. You can omit those lines if you don't need Home Assistant restart/reload features.

Access the interface at `http://localhost:54001`.

</details>

## Configuration

### App Options

In Home Assistant app mode, you can track files outside `/config` by setting `additional_paths` in the app configuration.

Example:

```yaml
include_extensions:
  - yaml
  - yml
  - conf
additional_paths:
  - /share
  - /share/mqtt
```

Notes:
- Paths must be absolute and currently support `/share`, `/media`, `/ssl`, and `/config` prefixes.
- Paths under `/config` are skipped because `/config` is already tracked automatically.
- Files are still filtered by `include_extensions` and `exclude_files`.
- For `.conf` files, add `conf` to `include_extensions`.

Example use case:

### Tracking Remote Shares (NAS/Network Storage)

<details>
<summary>Click to view guide on versioning remote shares</summary>

You can use the `additional_paths` feature to version control configurations stored on remote shares (like a NAS or another server). This is perfect for tracking Frigate configurations or other Docker-based apps running elsewhere.

**Step 1: Set up Network Storage in Home Assistant**
1.  Navigate to **Settings** → **System** → **Storage**.
2.  Click **"Add network storage"**.
3.  Give it a name (e.g., `frigate`).
4.  Set **Usage** to `Share` or `Media`.
5.  Enter your server details and mount point.

**Step 2: Add to Version Control**
Once mounted, the share will be available at `/share/frigate` (if usage was set to Share) or `/media/frigate` (if set to Media). Add this path to your `additional_paths` in the app configuration:

```yaml
additional_paths:
  - /share/frigate
```

**Benefits:**
- **Frigate Configuration Recovery**: If a complex config change breaks your detection, you can instantly see the side-by-side diff and roll back your `config.yml` to a known working state, even if Frigate is running on a completely separate machine or VM.

</details>

### Runtime Settings

<details>
<summary>Click to view advanced settings and environment variables</summary>

The application can be configured through the web UI Settings page or via environment variables for containerized deployments.

#### Available Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Debounce Time** | Time to wait after detecting changes before creating a commit | `5 seconds` |
| **History Retention** | Automatically merge old commits to keep history clean | `Disabled` |
| **Retention Type** | Keep history based on time or number of versions | `time` |
| **Retention Value** | How much history to keep (number of days/hours/weeks/months or versions) | `90` |
| **Retention Unit** | Time unit for retention (hours, days, weeks, months) | `days` |
| **Max Commits to Show** | Limit the number of recent versions to display (for performance) | `Disabled` |

#### Environment Variable Configuration

For containerized deployments (especially when not persisting the `/data` directory), you can configure runtime settings using environment variables. This is particularly useful for:
- Docker/Podman deployments without persistent data volumes
- Infrastructure-as-code configurations
- Automated deployments with predefined settings

**Precedence order (per-setting):**
1. **Settings file** (`/data/runtime-settings.json`) - highest priority
2. **Environment variables** - middle priority
3. **Default values** - fallback

#### Environment Variable Reference

| Environment Variable | Setting | Type | Valid Values | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DEBOUNCE_TIME` | Debounce Time | Number | ≥ 0 | `5` |
| `DEBOUNCE_TIME_UNIT` | Debounce Time Unit | String | `seconds`, `minutes`, `hours`, `days` | `seconds` |
| `HISTORY_RETENTION` | History Retention | Boolean | `true`, `false`, `yes`, `no`, `1`, `0` | `false` |
| `RETENTION_TYPE` | Retention Type | String | `time`, `versions` | `time` |
| `RETENTION_VALUE` | Retention Value | Number | ≥ 1 | `90` |
| `RETENTION_UNIT` | Retention Unit | String | `hours`, `days`, `weeks`, `months` | `days` |
| `LIMIT_HISTORY` | Limit History | Boolean | `true`, `false`, `yes`, `no`, `1`, `0` | `false` |
| `MAX_COMMITS` | Max Commits | Number | 50 - 10000 | `500` |

**Notes:**
- Boolean values are case-insensitive and accept: `true`/`false`, `yes`/`no`, `1`/`0`
- String values (units, types) are case-insensitive: `SECONDS` and `seconds` are equivalent
- Invalid values trigger warnings in logs and fall back to defaults
- Empty values are ignored

#### Docker Examples

**Docker Compose with environment variables:**
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  havc:
    image: ghcr.io/saihgupr/home-assistant-version-control:latest
    ports:
      - "54001:54001"
    volumes:
      - /path/to/your/config:/config
    environment:
      - TZ=America/New_York
      - DEBOUNCE_TIME=10
      - DEBOUNCE_TIME_UNIT=minutes
      - HISTORY_RETENTION=true
      - RETENTION_TYPE=time
      - RETENTION_VALUE=30
      - RETENTION_UNIT=days
```

**Docker Run with environment variables:**
```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 54001:54001 \
  -v /path/to/your/config:/config \
  -e TZ=America/New_York \
  -e DEBOUNCE_TIME=10 \
  -e DEBOUNCE_TIME_UNIT=minutes \
  -e HISTORY_RETENTION=true \
  -e RETENTION_TYPE=time \
  -e RETENTION_VALUE=30 \
  -e RETENTION_UNIT=days \
  --name home-assistant-version-control \
  ghcr.io/saihgupr/home-assistant-version-control:latest
```

**Validation and Logging:**

When the container starts, you'll see detailed logging showing where each setting value came from:
```
[init] Runtime settings loaded:
[init]   debounceTime: 10 (env: DEBOUNCE_TIME)
[init]   debounceTimeUnit: 'minutes' (env: DEBOUNCE_TIME_UNIT)
[init]   historyRetention: true (env: HISTORY_RETENTION)
[init]   retentionType: 'time' (default)
[init]   retentionValue: 30 (env: RETENTION_VALUE)
[init]   retentionUnit: 'days' (default)
```

Invalid values will trigger warnings:
```
[init] Warning: Invalid DEBOUNCE_TIME='abc', Expected integer, got: 'abc'. Using default: 5
```

</details>

## How It Works

<details>
<summary>Technical details about the monitoring and commit workflow</summary>

### The Workflow
1.  **File Watcher:** The system continuously monitors your `/config` folder for changes to YAML files.
2.  **Stabilization:** When a change is detected, it waits **2 seconds** to ensure Home Assistant has finished writing the file (preventing corruption).
3.  **Debounce:** It then waits for your configured **Debounce Time** (default 5s) to batch related edits into a single commit.
4.  **Snapshot:** A Git commit is created with a timestamp.
5.  **Cleanup:** If enabled, old snapshots are consolidated periodically.

### What is Tracked?
The app automatically tracks configuration files while ignoring system files.

| Tracked ✅ | Ignored ❌ |
| :--- | :--- |
| `configuration.yaml` | Database files (`.db`, `.db-shm`) |
| `automations.yaml`, `scripts.yaml` | Log files (`*.log`) |
| `secrets.yaml` | Python cache (`__pycache__`) |
| Lovelace dashboards (`.storage/lovelace*`) | Binary files (Images, Videos) |
| `esphome/*.yaml` | Temporary files |
| All other `.yaml` and `.yml` files | Files in `.gitignore` |
| Files in `.storage/` | Temporary files |

### Automatic Branch Detection
The app is branch-agnostic and will automatically detect the active branch of your repository. 
- **New Installations:** Automatically default to `main`.
- **Existing Repositories:** If your repository already uses `master` (or any other branch), the app will detect it and continue to use it without intervention.
- **Manual Branch Swapping:** If you manually rename your branch (e.g., `git branch -m master main`), the app will automatically update its sync logic to match the new branch name.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Secrets Management & Cloud Backup:**
> By default, `secrets.yaml` is **excluded** from version control to protect sensitive information like passwords and API keys. If you use the Cloud Backup feature and choose to include `secrets.yaml`, ensure your remote repository is **private** and understand that secrets will be stored in Git history. Consider using Home Assistant's built-in secrets management or environment variables for sensitive data instead.

> [!TIP]
> **Excluding Files:**
> You can prevent specific files from being tracked by adding them to a `.gitignore` file in your `/config` directory. Just list the filenames (one per line) that you want to exclude, and the app will automatically ignore them from version control.

</details>

## Cloud Sync (GitHub/Gitea)

<details>
<summary>Remote backup and custom Git server setup</summary>

You can automatically sync your configuration to a private remote repository. This is highly recommended for off-site backups.

### Custom Repository Setup (Gitea/Self-Hosted)

If you are using a custom Git server like Gitea, follow these steps to ensure a smooth sync (note: this is **not** required for standard GitHub setups):

1.  **Create a Private Repository:** Log in to your Git server and manually create a **private** repository named `VersionControlBackup` before attempting to sync from the UI.
2.  **Authentication URL:** Use the following URL format in the Cloud Sync settings, substituting your token, IP/domain, and username:
    ```
    http://YOUR_API_TOKEN@YOUR_SERVER_IP:PORT/YOUR_USERNAME/VersionControlBackup.git
    ```
